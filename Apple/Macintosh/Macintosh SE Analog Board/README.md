# Macintosh Analog Board SE

Schematics currently available:
* [[PDF]](/Macintosh/Macintosh SE Analog board/Macintosh SE Analog Board) Apple IIc (PAL) Macintosh SE Analog Board - captured by [@baldengineer](https://github.com/baldengineer)

## SE or SE/30?
The schematic source listed the analog board under the SE. However, there is a handwritten note that says it is the SE/30. My guess is that the analog board is the same in both machines. 

## KiCad Version
Project Created with KiCad 8.
