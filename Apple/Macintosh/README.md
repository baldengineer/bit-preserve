# Macintosh Schematic Notes
These schematics cover all-in-on Machintosh. 

Schematics currently available:
* [[PDF]](/Macintosh/Macintosh SE Analog board/Macintosh SE Analog Board) Apple IIc (PAL) Macintosh SE Analog Board - captured by [@baldengineer](https://github.com/baldengineer)

## Macintosh SE is Work-In-Progress
The schematic source for the SE Logic board is a huge mess. I (James) need to get some experience with other Macintosh designs to better decode it.

## KiCad Version
Project created with KiCad 8.
