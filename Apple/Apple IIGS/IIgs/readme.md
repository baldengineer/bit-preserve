# Redrawn Schematic
* ROM3 (1 Mb): [KiCad](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve/tree/master/Apple/Apple%20IIGS/IIgs/ROM3%20Schematic), [PDF](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve/blob/master/Apple/Apple%20IIGS/IIgs/Apple%20IIGS%20ROM3%20Schematic%20-%20Redrawn.pdf)

### Scanned PDF Schematics used for referenc
You can contribute to Bit Preserve too! Grab one of these schematics and start redrawing it. It's super simple and takes almost no time. (note, it only takes "no time" if you don't keep track of time.)
