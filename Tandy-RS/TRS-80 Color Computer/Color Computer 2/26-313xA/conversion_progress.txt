====NOTES======

-PIA R/W error in schematic.
The schematic shows R/W going  from the CPU to pin 34 of the PIA's which is RESET
on the PIA's. If you buzz it out on the board itself, you find that R/W actually
connects to pin 21 of the PIA's which is R/W on the PIA's. This makes more sense.

IC5 has R/W and RESET swapped.

-SAM E and Q
The schematic shows E going from the SAM to the Q input on the CPU
snd it shows Q going from the SAM to the E input of the CPU.

-JOYSTICK ports.
C24 and C25 are swapped.

- D12 and D13 are in the schematic but not on the board.

IC2 on the schematic has +5V on pin 40 and then an additional +5V via FB3.
The board only has it via FB3 or rather pin 40 is not directly connected to 
the +5V rail.
