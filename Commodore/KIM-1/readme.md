# KIM-1 Schematic

## Sources
The schematic for the KIM-1 was taken from the followinf source materials:
- KIM-1 users manual
- The MOS technology hardware manual for the 65xx series
- The KIM-1 wall poster

All were origional materials that came with the reference KIM-1 system.

## Exceptions
There were a few places when component values in the documentaion didn't 
match the actual values in the reference system. In these cases I used 
the actual value in the reference system on the schematic.

These exceptions were:
- R18..R23 Are 220 ohm in the documentation, 100 ohm in the reference system.

## Pictures
I've also include clear pictures of the reference system in case someone wants
to take on the PCB layout.
