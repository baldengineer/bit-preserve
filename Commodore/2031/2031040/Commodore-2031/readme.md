# Commodore 2031 - 050-0051-D

Work-in-progress capture of schematics for the Commodore 2031 drive (PCB assembly 2031040) captured in KiCad by [@rjhelms](https://github.com/rjhelms).

Original schematic source: https://www.commodore.ca/manuals/funet/cbm/schematics/drives/old/2031/index.html

## Notes on conventions used

* The original schematic uses positional designators for ICs, of the form "U5M". KiCad expects designators to end in a numeral, so this has been reversed to "UM3".
