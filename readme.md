# Bit Preserve
Recreating classic computer schematics. Let's convert all those random scanned PDFs into a modern, editiable and re-usable format.

# How it works
* Pick a system
* Find a schematic
* And start drawing!

This project uses [KiCad](http://kicad.org) for capturing schematics. 

# Notes
* If there are variants of the schematic, give them their own directory. 
* If you see a system you'd like to contribute but it isn't listed, submit a pull request. 
* If you start working on a system, please do a PR on the readme file in that directory and put your name there as "working on it." 
* Have suggestions or questions? Then [submit an issue](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve/issues)!

# Rules - More like Guidelines
My goal is to have minimal rules. Right now I'd like to focus on documenting these systems *somewhere*. Someday, we might develop a style guide.

Bit Preserve has a few simple rules:
1. Do not upload bitmapped PDFs or images of original schematics. Instead, please link to repositories for that specific system instead.
2. Use KiCad's [Plot -> PDF] of the Schematic (not print!) when "done."
3. Add a link in the README to that PDF to make finding them easier.
4. Originally, we did not share symbol libraries between systems. (This was before KiCad changed how symbols get imported and linked in a schematic)
5. If you decide to re-create the PCB, **Please do NOT upload large binaries like STEP files**. Contact me if you want to include STEPs. (We'll do it as a submodule.)

# Questions or Ideas
Please, [submit an issue](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve/issues). In most cases, there is no need to email me. I want open discussions about how we move forward.
