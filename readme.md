# Bit Preserve
Recreating classic computer schematics. Let's convert all those random scanned PDFs into a modern, editiable and re-usable format.

Most of the directories are empty. They represent the structure I had initially had in mind. I'm working on the Apple IIgs ROM3 schematic. Another contributor has provided schematics for the Altair 8800. There is plenty of room for you to contribute!

# How it works
Pick a system, find a schematic, and start drawing. The project has picked [KiCad](http://kicad.org) as the primary schematic capture tool. If there are variants of the schematic, give them their own directory. If you see a system you'd like to contribute but it isn't listed, just [submit a pull request](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve/pulls). If you start working on a system, do a pull on the readme file in that directory and put your name there as "working on it." 

Have suggestions on how to manage that workflow? Then [submit an issue](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve/issues)!

# More information
I first announced this project at KiCon 2019. Here are some links to get background about the project.
* Watch my original talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBaU4JZOVzk

# Rules
My goal is to have minimal rules. Right now I'd like us all to focus on documenting these systems *somewhere*. After we get a few more systems captured and a few more people contributing, then we can develop a style guide. 

So for now, Bit Preserve has three simple rules:
1. Do not upload bitmapped PDFs or images of original schematics. Instead, please link to repositories for that specific system instead.
2. Use KiCad
3. Don't be a dweeb

One change to #1 from above: PDFs of the KiCad schematic is acceptable. But, please make sure the schematic file has a revision and date which is reflected in the PDF. 

# Questions or Ideas
Please, [submit an issue](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve/issues). In most cases, there is no need to email me. I want open discussions about how we move forward.
