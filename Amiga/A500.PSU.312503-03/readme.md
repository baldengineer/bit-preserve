# Amiga A500 Power Suppy P/N 312503 Rev 03

The schematic was drawn up in KiCad 5.1.5 and was created by tracing the layout on the PCB.

I was unable to find the schematics online and needed to repair a blown PSU so put this schematic together. 

I've included components references on the schematic however on the PCB version I have there is no silkscreen whatsoever making it even more difficult to troubleshoot.

The schematic should be correct based on the PCB layout however there could be some errors I have missed.
